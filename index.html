	   				<p class="lead">We want to understand the reasons behind why student’s, parent’s, and stakeholders face problems during the admission process as well as the problems faced by them while online payment processes and the highly stressful, frustrating and extensive paper-based process.</p>

	   		<div class="col-twelve">

	   			<h3 class="themecolor">Hypothesis</h3>

			      	<ul class="disc">
						<li>Eliminate admission bottlenecks and simplify your operations with customized application processes for better results.</li>
						<li>Student’s asking silly questions.</li>
						<li>Pressure from the higher commodities on them.</li>
				   	</ul>

		   	    <h5>Student point of view</h5>
	   				<ul>
	   					<li>Social anxiety, general anxiety, test anxiety, or panic attacks affects the students interest in the admission procedure.</li>
	   					<li>Family expectations or problems have the greatest burden on one’s mind.</li>
	   					<li>Depression, lack of energy or motivation, hopelessness, low self-esteem, loneliness affects the student’s engagement in the subject.</li>
	   					<li>The application is incomplete. Missing test scores, and other applicant’s materials create a noise/kiosk in a student's mind.</li>
	   					<li>If you applied to colleges where there is rolling admission, it generally can take six to eight weeks to receive a decision which ultimately leads the student to think that he/she will not get admitted to that particular college/university.</li>
	   					<li>A 4.0 GPA is not good enough i.e. a cut off list for the colleges leads the student to think helpless/hopeless.</li>
	   					<li>The caste certificate quota leads a student with an open category to not take admission over there.</li>
	   				</ul>
	   			<h5>Paper based process</h5>
					<ul>
						<li>It is so time consuming, frustrating and highly stressful that a large number of students miss the deadlines for college applications.</li>
						<li>Application form is not user friendly because of many issues for students or parents while filling it online, also, it is not easy to navigate, simple.</li>
						<li>Staff workload is heavy due to this.</li>
						<li>Poor/ Confusing user journey.</li>
					</ul>
				<h5>Not device friendly</h5>
					<ul>
						<li>Forms are not device friendly; it gets very difficult for those who do not have a desktop/laptop.</li>
						<li>We can only fill out forms from a particular device by which the person gets frustrated.</li>
					</ul>
				<h5>No Navigation in the Campus.</h5>
					<ul>
						<li>New Students Don’t have any idea about the campus, also there is no proper navigation in the campus</li>
					</ul>
				<h5>No option of Query Resolution of students during form filling.</h5>
					<ul>
						<li>Students are anxious while filling the online form.it is essential to resolve individual queries related to admission form. There is no chat bots option to resolve this problem.</li>
					</ul>
				<h5>Communicating with applicants.</h5>
					<ul>
						<li>Admission Process involves various process like form filling,</li>
						<li>Merit List Publishing, Original Document verification. Each steps involves</li>
						<li>Communication with prospective students.</li>
					</ul>
				<h5>Online payment is a problem for students and staff</h5>
					<ul>
						<li>Students face lots of problems while online payment reasons, websites not working, connectivity, on-line payment, system requirement, cost of transaction and lack of customer care etc.</li>
						<li>In one survey people found that 75% of people find out it so difficulties in online payment</li>
						<li>Not all students have debit cards, credit cards, online banking etc. Therefore, for this they have to go in search of this online payment. Rural area students have many difficulties as they do not have their cards etc. So sometimes, they have to depend on other people, relatives for online payment.</li>
						<li>There are many technological problems in it. Sometimes even if they are not notified that they have paid it sir not no helpline no or enquiry number are there to talk on cog website.</li>
						<li>There are no speedy transactions.</li>
						<li>Even staff members have difficulties while using this new technology.</li>
						<li>Due to slow internet or new functions, they face problems even if they make mistakes in payment.</li>
						<li>People are also afraid of some frauds and their personal information.</li>
					</ul>
				<h5>Not being notified, due dates to staff and student creates a sort of tension in their minds.</h5>
					<ul>
						<li>There are no notification or deadline for particular form so students even miss there dates and due to this form or admission is cancelled</li>
						<li>They do not even get payment notification on time due to that transaction sometimes they think it is not done and they do it twice.</li>
						<li>Due to error and slow internet, they do fill forms but it has not shown to them that there is some error and students miss their form.</li>
						<li>Old staff who are not regular touch with this online process are so slow to check all forms and payments so even they get frustrated, even if they are not notified on time they pass a false list sometime. Student entry that is not done.</li>
					</ul>
				<h5>Cost of online admissions</h5>
					<ul>
						<li>There is not whole thing about college not a good guidance our even images of campus leads the impression so bad even sometime website don’t respond fast and website don’t work 24/7</li>
						<li>They are not given any guidance on the infrastructure or facilities of college.</li>
						<li>Not a good communicating system is seen.</li>
						<li>In one survey people came to know that 75% of students told that online admission are more costly than manual one mainly this problems are faced by Rural students reasons are Bank commission ,Internet browsing cafe charges ,printing, Transportation charges to go bank, challan charges.</li>

   	   			<h5>Navigation inside the campus</h5>
   			      	<p class="drop-cap">Yash has just passed his 12th boards and looking for a university in Pune. Yash lives in Mumbai and was looking for a design course. As he is not a localite he is visiting Pune for the first time. And he doesn’t know anything about the location of the college and about the college campus too. He wanted to visit the design dept. inside the campus, as he was late for the admissions he directly wanted to head to the dept. without wasting his time by searching for it or by asking someone where exactly the department is. But when he reached the location he was shocked, as the college was too big i.e. the campus was too huge and there was no indication of the department he was searching for. There were around 12 – 14 huge buildings and there was no naming or signboards to the way he was finding for. So end up asking to some of the students but the students or the people were also not knowing about the design dept. and then he was just searching for the dept. where the road head to and wasted his 1 to 2 hours in searching for the same.<br>
   			      	And then after that he decided to go back to his place but then he randomly asked one girl approaching to his side, about the design department. Then he just explained her what all things he had done for searching the dept. Then she told him that not to worry, there is an app provided by the college which can help you to navigate inside the campus wherever you want. And then she guided him with the app. At the end Yash was finally able to search for the department he wanted to visit within no time.</p>
